## 1) Checking Status And Logs

#### We can gather information like:
              1. Whether the current branch is up to date
              2. Whether there is anything to commit, push or pull
              3. Whether there are files staged, unstaged or untracked
              4. Whether there are files created, modified or deleted

### Terminal Command

	git status
	git log
	
	
## 2) Git Clone

#### Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository 
#### For example, if we want to download a project from Github, all we need to do is click on the green button (clone or download), copy the URL in the box and paste it after the  git clone command that I've shown right above.
	
	git clone <https://repository___link>
